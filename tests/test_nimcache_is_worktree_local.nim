## Every Nim compile in this checkout keeps its nimcache INSIDE the checkout.
##
## WHY.  Nim's default nimcache (`~/.cache/nim/<project>_d`, `_r` for
## -d:release, `%USERPROFILE%\nimcache\<project>_d` on Windows) is keyed by the
## project NAME only, and the generated file names inside it are the same in
## every checkout.  Two checkouts of this repository building the same project
## at the same time therefore share one set of intermediate files, and a build
## can exit 0 with the other checkout's code linked in.  The repo-root
## `config.nims` moves every such cache to
## `<checkout>/.nimcache/<main module's dir>/<module name>_<d|r|check>`; its
## header has the details.
##
## WHAT THIS CHECKS.
##   1. SELF.  The nimcache this test binary was itself compiled with, baked in
##      at compile time by `querySetting(nimcacheDir)`, is inside the checkout.
##      So a test runner that bypasses the config fails here, not only a
##      config that is wrong.
##   2. LAYOUT.  `nim dump` reports exactly the documented directory for this
##      file (from the repo root and from its own directory) and for the main
##      modules below, in debug (`_d`) and with -d:release (`_r`); and an
##      explicit `--nimcache:` on the command line still wins.
##   3. CONTROL.  The same probe with `--skipParentCfg`, which switches the
##      repo-root config off, must resolve OUTSIDE the checkout.  If it does
##      not, the probe cannot tell a shared cache from a local one, every
##      verdict above is vacuous, and the run fails saying so.
##
## Cost: a handful of `nim dump` probes (config evaluation only, no compile),
## about a second in total.
##
## NO MOCKS: the real compiler, the real config files, the real checkout.
