## Worktree-local nimcache: every Nim compile inside this checkout keeps its
## intermediate files (its nimcache) INSIDE this checkout.
##
## WHY.  Nim's default nimcache is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/nim/<project>_d` (`_r` for
## -d:release; `%USERPROFILE%\nimcache\<project>_d` on Windows).  It is keyed by
## the project NAME only, and the generated file names inside it do not depend
## on the checkout path either.  So two worktrees or clones of this repository
## that build the same project at the same time write, compile and link each
## other's intermediate files.  Measured on 2026-09-26 in a sibling repository:
## ten concurrent builds of two worktrees that differed in a few places gave
## four correct binaries, two that exited 0 with the OTHER worktree's code
## linked in (one of them a mix of both), two compile failures on
## half-rewritten generated C and two link failures.
##
## WHAT.  `<checkout>/.nimcache/<directory of the main module, relative to the
## checkout>/<module name><suffix>`, where the suffix is Nim's own: `_check`
## for `nim check`, `_r` for -d:release or -d:danger, `_d` otherwise.  The
## directory is part of the key, so same-named modules in different directories
## no longer share a cache either.  Only the intermediates move; build outputs
## stay where they were.  An explicit `--nimcache:` on the command line still
## wins, because Nim applies the command line again after the config files.
## `nim js` and project-less invocations are left alone.
##
## HOW IT IS PICKED UP.  Nim runs the `config.nims` of every PARENT directory of
## the compiled module, outermost first, then the one in the module's own
## directory.  So this file applies to every compile under this checkout,
## `just`, `nimble`, CI and a bare `nim c` alike, whatever the working directory.
## `--skipParentCfg` switches it off for modules below the checkout root, so a
## recipe that passes that flag must name its own checkout-local `--nimcache:`.
## Nothing in this repository passes `--skipParentCfg` today.
## `tests/test_nimcache_is_worktree_local.nim` checks the layout, and fails if the
## config is bypassed; its `--skipParentCfg` negative control proves the probe
## can see a shared cache at all.
##
## WINDOWS.  Nim turns the `/` below into `\` on a Windows host.  The layout adds
## `\.nimcache\<module dir>\<module>_d\` in front of Nim's own object file names,
## so keep the checkout root short (about 80 characters) to stay inside MAX_PATH.
